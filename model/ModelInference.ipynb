        "  Great white sharks in the Mediterranean Sea are in danger of disappearing, with illegal fishing contributing to their decline.\n",
        "  This is according to research by US scientists, working in partnership with UK charity Blue Marine Foundation. They say some of the most threatened species - including great white sharks - are being sold in North African fish markets.\n",
        "  Great whites are one of more than 20 Mediterranean shark species protected under international law, meaning it is illegal to fish for them or to sell them.\n",
        "  By monitoring fishing ports on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, however, researchers discovered that at least 40 great white sharks have been killed there in 2025 alone.\n",
        "  The BBC has also found, and independently verified, footage from social media of protected sharks being brought dead into North African ports.\n",
        "  One video showed a large great white being hauled ashore from a fishing boat in Algeria. Another, filmed in Tunisia, shows heads and fins of what appears to be a short-finned mako shark, which is also a threatened and protected species, being prepared for sale.\n",
        "  Lead researcher, Dr Francesco Ferretti from the US university Virginia Tech, explained that many shark populations - white sharks in particular - had declined dramatically in the Mediterranean in recent decades.\n",
        "  \"No other stretch of water is fished like the Mediterranean Sea,\" he said, speaking to the BBC News science team while working on a research vessel off the coast of Sicily in late 2025.\n",
        "  \"The impact of industrial fishing has been intensifying... and it's plausible that they will go extinct in the near future.\"\n",
        "  The Mediterranean white shark population is now classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.\n",
        "  In their latest attempt to find and study the predators, Dr Ferretti and his team worked in the Strait of Sicily - an area between Sicily and North Africa that has been identified as a \"last stronghold\" in the Mediterranean for several threatened shark species.\n",
        "  One key aim of their mission was to fit a satellite tracking tag onto a white shark - something that has never been done in the Mediterranean Sea.\n",
        "  To attempt this, the researchers brought more than three tonnes of fish bait - a shipping container packed with frozen mackerel and tuna scraps, as well as 500 litres of tuna oil to create a \"fat slick\" that many sharks would be able to smell from hundreds of metres away.\n",
        "  Despite working for two weeks - baiting the ocean, taking samples of seawater to search for shark DNA and using underwater cameras - the researchers did not manage to find any animals to tag.\n",
        "  They captured only a brief glimpse of one blue shark on their submarine cameras.\n",
        "  \"It's disheartening,\" Dr Ferretti told us. \"It just shows how degraded this ecosystem is.\"\n",
        "  While the team was searching for surviving sharks, they also received reports that a juvenile great white had been caught and killed in a North African fishery - just 20 nautical miles from where they were working.\n",
